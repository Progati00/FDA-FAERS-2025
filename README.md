# FDA FAERS Q2 2025 â€“ Data Cleaning, Integration & Dashboard Analysis

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project processes the **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Q2 2025** dataset (Aprilâ€“June 2025, published July 29, 2025).  
The objective was to **clean, standardize, and merge** multiple raw data sources into one analysis-ready dataset, then visualize key insights using **Power BI**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information
**Source:** [FDA FAERS Quarterly Data Extract Files](https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html)  
The files contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time range and are not cumulative.

The Q2 2025 dataset contains six separate sheets:

| Sheet Name  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `INDI25Q2`  | Drug indication details |
| `OUTC25Q2`  | Reported outcomes |
| `REAC25Q2`  | Reported reactions |
| `RPSR25Q2`  | Report sources |
| `DRUG25Q2`  | Drug details |
| `DEMO25Q2`  | Patient demographics |

---

## ðŸ›  Data Preparation Process (MySQL Workbench)

### 1. Data Import
- Imported all six datasets into **MySQL Workbench** as separate tables.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns.
- Standardized formats and replaced missing/blank values with placeholders (`'Unknown'`, `0`).
- Removed duplicates and records with `NULL` values in key fields.
- Normalized text and numeric fields for consistency.

### 3. Data Integration
- Performed `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` operations on `primaryid` and `caseid`.
- Merged all six tables into a **single table** named `combined_faers`.

## ðŸ“‘ Final Table Structure â€“ `combined_faers`

| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `primaryid`, `caseid` | Unique report identifiers |
| `age`, `sex`, `wt` | Patient demographics |
| `reporter_country`, `occr_country` | Reporting & occurrence country |
| `drug_seq`, `role_cod`, `drugname`, `prod_ai`, `val_vbm`, `route` | Drug details |
| `indi_drug_seq`, `indi_pt` | Medical indication |
| `outc_cod` | Reported outcome |
| `pt` | Reported reaction |

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Data Transformation
- Added **Age Groups**:
  - Child/Adolescent: `<18`
  - Young Adult: `18â€“44`
  - Middle-aged Adult: `45â€“64`
  - Older Adult: `65+`
  - Unknown: Missing values
